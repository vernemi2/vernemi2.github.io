excerpt: "Something about me and my career."

I am a software developer with almost 8 years experiences. I started as a test engineer during my uni days, moved to Java development where I worked on one of the best projects with fantastic people. In that time I had an opportunity to learn something new and try some of the emerging platforms on the market. That's how I started with Salesforce. I liked the idea to have platform with some basic business capability with the ability to extend it as needed. Apex is quite similar to Java so it enabled me to learn how to develop, build and deploy to platform fairly quickly.

So far I have worked on Force.com platform for almost 4 years now and was able to explore different parts of Salesforce, build lots of different types of solutions, see how Salesforce is used in different industries and hit almost every limit, almost ðŸ™‚.

Salesforce is a leader in CRM space and is evolving fairly quickly so it is really exiting to have the opportunity to be part of it all.
